# What is Joe Time?
You may be wondering what Joe Time is. It was a term coined by myself to describe how my friend Joe perceives time as compared to the rest of the world. He is very often late (if showing up at all), so myself, along with my good friend, created a formula to calculate the approximate time of his arrival as compared to what he claimed.

## How does it work?

The (not yet patented) formula is rather simple, yet highly accurate. In order to understand the formula, let's now go over the variables involved.

A = the time in which Joe took to respond in regards to his arrival time
B = Joe's current age. His birthdate is January 24, 2000.
C = The amount of time Joe said it would take him to arrive. This sometimes requires guesswork. If he says he will be leaving his house a 2pm, and it takes 1 hour to get to my house, then C = 1hr (60 min).

The aforementioned formula is:

    (((a + b) * c) * .37) ÷ 2
  
For example, let's say it took Joe 15 minutes to respong to my text. He also said he would arrive in 30 minutes. Currently, Joe is 21 years old.

    (((15 + 21) * 30) * .37) ÷ 2
    ((36 * 30) * .37) ÷ 2
    (1080 * .37) ÷ 2
    399.6 ÷ 2 = 199.8
    199.8 minutes = 3 hours and 20 minutes
    
### What's the point of all this?
Nothing. It was a joke that got way out of hand. I have spent many hours on this nonsense.
